# subnet-microservice
A microservice for different subnetting applications

# About this project:
Hello! Thanks for reading this. My name is Erik. This is a simple API I created that allows you to calculate the CIDR notation(AKA slash notation) 
of a subnet. I used it to learn NodeJS!

# What it does:
This project has a very simple purpose with only one API endpoint. It handles a post request with a number of hosts and the number of host bits.
